**Aspiring game developer|ITI Majorana|Passionate about computer science (generally for now)**

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm Loris Trono, currently an 11th-grade student, currently living in Italy(TO). Nice to meet you all!

About My Current Work & Studies:

ðŸ”­ I'm currently dedicating my time to working on various coding projects. It's a field I'm passionate about, even if I'm still honing my skills.

ðŸŒ± Speaking of skills, I'm deeply immersed in learning computer science. There's so much to discover, and I'm eager to absorb as much as I can.

Seeking Collaboration & Connections:

ðŸ¤” I'm actively looking for help with telecommunications. It's an area I find fascinating but could definitely use some guidance or collaboration on. If you have expertise in this field, I'd love to connect!

Get in Touch!

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about anything! I'm an open book and always happy to chat about my interests or anything else that comes to mind.

ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by searching for me on social media or, if you prefer a more direct approach, feel free to give me a call.

Just for Fun:

âš¡ Fun fact: Despite my enthusiasm for coding, I'll openly admit that I'm not that good at it... yet! But hey, that's what learning is all about, right?
